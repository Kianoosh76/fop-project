Can you name the following player that to this day has not been close to induction into the Hall of Fame? Plases – Super Bowl winning quarterbac – AP NFL Most Valuable Player – AFC player of the year in two different year – 4 Pro Bowl – 7 consecutive winning season – Practically invente modern high percentage passin – Quickest to win 100 games, having done so in 150 games (later surpassed by Joe Montana – Perhaps the best clock/game managing QB in history… “Other then Joe, he was the best come from behind quarterback I have ever seen.” (Bill Walsh, Building a Champion, Page 30.) Minuses – He played on the wrong coast, in the wrong city – His haircut did not shout “I love juxtaposing military jingoism with sports.” How many NFL MVPs have never been voted into the HOF? Incompetence, bias and corruption sounds about right. That last line referred to the recent complaints about the Hall of Fame selection committee. As to the question, I guessed it right, although it took me much longer than it should have. See if you can figure it out and then click “read more” for the answer. The answer is the former Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler. There is a Facebook page devoted to his Hall of Fame candidacy. Here’s an excerpt in Sports Illustrated from a Peter Richmond book on the old Raiders: “How could he not be in the Hall of Fame?” asks John Vella now. “Are stats everything? Ask the Steeler defense in the ’70s. The best defense. Who would they have not wanted to face? Ask the Dolphin No-Name defense who would they not want to face in the clutch. That says it all. They would say to a man, ‘We don’t want to face Snake.'”

		Apple is expected to begin a much-anticipated foray into the textbook market at an event in New York next week.
The company sent invitations to reporters on Wednesday for an event at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York on Jan. 19. The background image looks like a chalkboard with an outline of the city skyline and the Apple logo scrawled on it. “Join us for an education announcement in the Big Apple,” the invitation read. The event will showcase a new push by Apple into the digital textbook business, but will not feature any new devices, according to a person close to the company who did not want to be identified talking about it before it occurred. Talk of such a move by Apple has been bubbling since a biography of Apple’s late chief executive, Steve Jobs, came out in October. In that book by Walter Isaacson, Mr. Jobs told him that he wanted to transform the textbook market by hiring prominent textbook writers to create electronic versions of them for the iPad. Mr. Jobs told the author that he believed Apple could get around state certification processes for textbooks by making them free.

		<title>In Los Angeles, a Police Force Transformed</title>

		It had all the makings of another turbulent moment for the Los Angeles Police Department, an agency once notorious for an “L.A. Confidential” style of heavy-handed policing, hostile relations with minorities and corruption. Two months after triumphantly announcing the arrest of a suspect in a brutal beating at Dodger Stadium, the police admitted that they had arrested the wrong man, and charged two other people with the crime. But unlike other potentially explosive episodes that have rocked this department over the decades, there were no indignant denials or attacks on critics. Instead, the police chief, Charlie Beck, wrote an op-ed article in The Los Angeles Times explaining what had gone wrong and expressing regret at some of his own public comments. “We can do much better,” Chief Beck wrote. The moment reflected what has been a revolution for the police department that was once the model for Sgt. Joe Friday and “Dragnet.” Twenty years after the police beating of Rodney King was caught on videotape, and 10 years after the Justice Department imposed a consent decree to battle pervasive corruption in the Rampart Division, this has become a department transformed, offering itself up — in a way that not so many years ago would have been unthinkable — as a model police agency for the United States. “It’s been an amazing transformation,” said John W. Mack, a former head of the Urban League who is the president of the Police Commission, the civilian board that oversees the force. “The L.A.P.D. of today is very, very different than 10, 12 years ago, when I was one of the people who was constantly battling them.”

		<title>F.D.A. Panel Urges Denial of Diet Drug</title>

		A federal advisory panel on Thursday recommended against approval of a new diet pill, the latest setback in efforts to develop treatments for the nation’s obesity epidemic. The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted 9 to 5 that the potential benefits of the drug, called lorcaserin and developed by Arena Pharmaceuticals, did not outweigh the risks. The vote indicated how tough it might be to win approval for obesity drugs. Some committee members said lorcaserin was not clearly unsafe. But even a mere suggestion of possible risks seemed unacceptable to some panel advisers because the drug did not help people lose much weight. “I really didn’t have a lot of issues with the risk,” said one panel member, Dr. Eric I. Felner, a diabetes expert at Emory University. Still, he voted no. “I just didn’t see it as being that efficacious.” The negative vote is the second setback this year in attempts to win approval for what would be the first new prescription weight-loss drug in more than a decade. Citing safety concerns, the same committee voted 10 to 6 in July against approval for the drug Qnexa from Vivus, a drug that produced a much greater weight loss among trial participants than lorcaserin. The F.D.A., which usually takes the advice of its committees, is expected to decide next month whether to approve lorcaserin or Qnexa.On Wednesday, the advisory panel split 8 to 8 on whether the diet drug Meridia, sold by Abbott Laboratories, should be removed from the market. A study showed that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with cardiovascular risk. The drug has already been removed from the market in Europe.

		A ship commissioned by a Libyan charity has left Greece with food and medical supplies for Gaza, but it remains unclear whether it will challenge the Israeli blockade of sea routes to the territory. Greek authorities said the ship was headed to the Egyptian port of Al Arish, and not for Gaza, as originally planned. But Youssef Sawani, executive director of the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation, which has mounted the aid operation, said that the goal remained to unload the supplies in Gaza. Still, Mr. Sawani said that the ship, the Amalthea, would not seek confrontation with the Israelis and that it would seek another “appropriate” destination if the Israelis refused to give it access to Gaza. The Amalthea’s trip, which is expected to last several days, comes more than a month after Israeli commandos killed nine Turks in a raid on a flotilla trying to break the Gaza blockade.

		<title>Chinese Oil Company Bids $15 Billion for Canadian Producer</title>

		China is making its biggest and boldest grab for overseas energy resources yet in a $15 billion deal for a Canadian oil producer. A takeover of Nexen by China National Offshore Oil Corporation, the Chinese state-run oil giant known as Cnooc (pronounced SEE-nook), would give China a number of footholds in the Gulf of Mexico, the Canadian oil sands in Alberta, the North Sea and the waters off Nigeria. The Nexen deal, announced on Monday, is the latest effort by China to amass the natural resources it needs to stoke its powerful engine of growth. In particular, the country’s leadership has been focused on reducing dependence on oil imports, as China consumes some nine million barrels of oil a day, second only to the United States. “From China’s point of view, the main issue has been energy security, and it always will be,” Paul Ting, an independent energy analyst, said. And for Nexen, which is based in Calgary, the deal will provide an alternative to a stagnant United States market, where prices for Canadian oil have been weak. But the transaction, coming seven years after Cnooc abandoned an $18.5 billion bid for Unocal of the United States in the face of heated political opposition to the deal, will be a huge test of whether regulators are now more willing to accept Chinese ownership of strategic assets. Regulators in Canada, the United States and elsewhere will need to sign off on the acquisition. Unease over China’s buying spree has lingered since the failed Unocal takeover, dissuading many Chinese companies from bidding for outright control of strategic assets.
